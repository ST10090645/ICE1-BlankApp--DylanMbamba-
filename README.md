Setup Experience:

While the initial set-up while learning in class was a little confusing, after working on a few basic apps since then, the process has become significantly easier to remember and execute. Below I have summarized the set-up process in a few steps to make subsequent setups even simpler. The process is rather simple and I didn't particularly struggle at any point, however I whenever I did run into an error or an issue it was due to my spelling, so as with all forms of programming remembering the syntax and being accurate and precise is as important as ever.

Setup Steps:

1. Go to windows explorer -> Create a blank folder called MAST in documents (only the first time), as well as another inside the MAST folder that will be used for your new project (name it whatever you want). (File > Open/Close folders to open/close projects while inside VSCode).

2. After opening your new folder (project) in the MAST folder, go to Terminal > New Terminal in the taskbar.

3. In the new terminal, type "npx create-expo-app -t expo-template-blank-typescript".

4. Agree to the update if necessary, then name your file. (Usually a reverse of the folder name)

5. Right click on the name of the project (top left) and click open integrated terminal.

6. Open app.tsx

7. Install the "Prettier" and "Live Server" extension if you haven't already.

8. Open Blue stacks > Run for blustacks

9. After coding > open integrated terminal > "npx expo start".
